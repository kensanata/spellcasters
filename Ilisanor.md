### The Book of Weaving

**Rope command** (1) allows you to command up to 50ft of rope for
10min. It can slither like a snake, knot and unknot, trip people
passing over it, and so on.

**Silk** (1) allows you to weave up to 50ft of spider silk rope out of
thin air. At night, it allows you to catch moonlight and weave the
finest silk from it. A square up to 50×50ft of cloth can be created:
nets, sails, curtains, you name it.

**Spider climb** (1) allows anybody you touch into a half spider
centaur for 10min. With your legs, you can climb along any solid
surface or rope. With your spider silk gland, you can secure yourself
against falls when jumping.

**Spider hands** (2) allows you to locate the smallest vibrations
within 100ft using your fingertips. Anytime you touch the ground or a
wall in the next half hour, you can pinpoint living creatures within
range.

**Spider vision** (2) grows six extra eyes all around a head you
touch. For a day, they can see in all directions, and they can see all
sorts of additional fire like *jale* and *ulfire*. With these extra
sleepless eyes, they can no longer be surprised.

**Liquefy** (2) makes your jaw grow large, with acid glands, and if
you manage to bite somebody in that very moment, they must save
vs. poison or suffer 4d6 acid damage. If they're already dead, you can
liquefy a human-sized corpse (and drink the goo, if you feel like it).

**Phase walk** (3) allows you to see the maze of crisscrossing lines
connecting the realms and with one step, you can cross over to any of
the eight known realms: Asgard (city of the gods), Alfheim (elves),
Midgard (humans), Myrkheim (dwarves), Jötunheim (giants), Vanaheim
(demons), Niflheim (trolls), Muspelheim (salamanders). You appear far
from any watchful eyes but near a building. You can bring along
whatever you can carry, i.e. one other person.

**Web** (3) allows you to fill a 10ft cube with sticky spider webs.
Anybody caught in the web is automatically immobilised. It doesn't
burn very quickly: to free a passage filled with these webs takes
10min per 10ft. Anybody caught in a burning web takes 2d8 damage as
they free themselves. Anybody caught in a web with an open fire such
as a torch automatically sets it on fire.

**Observation** (3) gives you the power to observe what somebody is
doing, no matter where they are, if and only if you can eat a little
bit of their hair. The target must save vs. spell in order to notice
the strange presence in their mind. If they do, they may defend
themselves with mind-affecting spells such as *charms*, *mind blast*,
*mind reading*, *mind rot*, or *warp mind*.

**...** (4)

**Cut the thread of fate** (4) allows you see the life thread of a
living target up to 60ft away and cut it. The target must save
vs. death or die.

**Follow the thread** (4) allows you to create a silver thread that
leads you and up to three others to a destination you have been to.
The thread leads through wrinkles in the barrier between the realms
and thus effectively allows you to reach any destination with no more
than a dozen steps.
