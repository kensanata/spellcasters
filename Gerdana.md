## Gerdana

![Gerdana](Gerdana.png) Lady Geradana has ruled
the coastal elves of LagnabadalÃ« for over 250 years. Her elves fish
the waters around here and any other ships in the area will eventually
run afoul of unexplained mishaps and disappear.

One of the cracks in the rocks on which this small town has been built
contains a portal leading to a pocket realm containing crescent shaped
island surrounded by salt water and sunny beaches. Needless to say
this is a well guarded secret.

As is typical for elves, Gerdana's favorite shape is a dragon. She
spends hours and days as a blue dragon in her palace: AC -1
1d8/1d8/4d8 MV 24.

### The Book of the Sea

**Charm person** (1) affects a single target, save vs. spells to resist. To break free, victims save again every day if their intelligence is 13 or better, every week if their intelligence is average, or every month if their intelligence is 8 or lower. While charmed, victims will treat you as their best friend. Once victims break free, they will remember everything they did and if they did anything they would not have ordinarily have done, they will react with shame and anger. Charms usually cause severe emotional distress!

**Lunar Runes** (1) allows you to read and write the ancient elven runes powered by lunar magic for 20min. These runes are usually invisible or hidden within ornaments and other writing. This spell makes the lunar runes glow in a pale light, visible to all.

**Sleep** (1) puts 2d8 HD of creatures to sleep. It works on friend and foe alike, so it cannot safely be used against foes in melee. Lower hit-dice and lower hit-points are affected first. No save. Creatures with more than four hit-dice are immune.

**True Words** (2) allows you to look into the eyes of people and read their feelings, see their imaginations, and hear their thoughts unless they save vs. spells. These secrets are revealed to you across all language barriers. In order to learn something specific, the target must also think about it. How you make them do it is up to you. The target will know that you are there inside their head.

**Eternal Starlight** (2) can be cast on anything within 60ft; if you target anything with eyes, it must save vs. spells or be blinded (-4 to hit, no targeting of spells).

**Glamour** (2) is an illusion improving your looks in all respects, for a day: you look young and beautiful, your scars are gone, you smell of flowers, your voice is smooth and soothing. Like all illusions, anybody touching you may save vs. spells in order to see through it.

**Lightning Bolt** (3) strikes any visible foe within 200ft and everybody standing between you and them, unless they're very small or lying on the ground. Anything within two feet of the bolt will be affected and take 1d6 damage per caster level (5d6 minimum), save vs. spells for half damage.

**Water breathing** (3) allows one target to breathe underwater for one day. While breathing underwater, you can speak the languages of all marine creatures.

**Wind barrier** (3) prevents any flying thing from reaching you for 20min. Arrows, sling stones, rocks flung by giants, projectiles shot by siege weapons, all will be deflected.

**Decay** (4) is a curse that affects anything built by mortals: walls, buildings, ships, heirlooms. It doesn't matter. With a touch, you can speed up its decay by many magnitudes. Within minutes, part will be visible old and frail, after an hour or two later parts are failing and within a day the structure collapses.

**Flash flood** (4) creates a sudden flood from a body of water within 150 ft. Anybody caught by it must save vs. death or be swept away. If wearing metal armor, save vs. death again or drown within a minute or two.

**Shape change** (4) allows you to change your shape. You get all the physical and none of the mental abilities of your new shape: basically you get the new looks, the movement, the AC and the natural attacks. If your new shape can fly, so can you. If your new shape can't speak, you cannot cast spells. If the creature you changed into can breathe fire, you still cannot.

**Lunar Sailing** (5) summons a moon caravel. It will appear within 10min and carries up to 20 people. The moon caravel can sail through shallow waters and on moonlit nights, it can fly up into the air and cross any of the other realms the navigator knows how to find in their star charts. Each chart will name the location and realm it leads to.

**Summon Living Storm** (5) conjures an elemental, usually the air elemental called *Flying Debris*: HD 16 AC -2 3d8 F16 MV 36; plus 1d8 vs. flying creatures; requires a save vs. death to approach; immune to non-magical weapons; will attack summoner and remain on this plane if the conjurer's concentration fails.
