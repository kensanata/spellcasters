The *Golden Dome* is a half submerged church of the ancient order of the *Golden Snake* people. The dome itself rises above the waters of *Lake Heaven*. The road up to this crater lake is decorated with two thousand orange spirit gates. Up here, the secrets of *Aquamancy* are still being taught by Lady Jezembal and her disciples, Minetus and Udag.

The crater lake is full of ancient fish dreaming in the deep, cold waters, waiting for strangers to dive into the waters. There a few boat at the shore, allowing visitors to row to the *Golden Dome*. There, they will be welcomed by the watch.

== The Book of Aquamancy

The control of water presupposes the existence of enough water in the vicinity of the caster. The illustrations in the book show water bearers carrying water into battle using small canteens or larger waterskins.

|= Circle |= Spell |
| 1 |*Icicles* will lift a cup of water per level into the air and turn each one of them into an icicle. Next round, you can shoot them at designated target within 60ft dealing 1d6 damage each, save vs.Â spells for half. |
| 1 |*Ice Wall* pulls water up and freezes it into a thick ice barrier as big as a castle gate. This barrier has 2d6 hit points per level and AC 9. |
| 1 |*Wave* moves a body water such that a wave 10ft high forms and moves in any direction you want. If you can, you may surf on it. If the wave crashes into land, it deals 2d6 damage to anybody within 20ft. The wave will keep moving as fast as a human can run for as long as you concentrate. |
| 2 |*Tentacles* pulls water up and turns your two arms into watery tentacles with water drawn from a nearby source. This gives you two melee attacks per round for 1d6 damage each. At level 5 these arms can grow up to 30ft long. |
| 2 |*Frozen path* freezes water in front of you for as long as you concentrate. If you need to run, save vs. spells to keep the ice growing fast enough. The frozen path is 10ft wide will melt naturally. The ice can be broken by attacks dealing 3d6 damage or more. You can reverse the spell to create a water path through ice. |
| 2 |*Energy* invigorates the beaten and the wounded. Lay your hands on a victim and restore 2d6+1 hit points. |
| 3 |*Water breathing* allows one target to breathe underwater for one day. |
| 3 |*Ice storm* lets the winds of the void crash through into our reality, drawing a line of ice and cold from you towards any target you point to within 120ft. Anybody caught up in the blast must save vs. spells and take 3d10 damage or be covered by magic ice. The magic ice will weaken and break in 10min if the air is warm enough, or if it is smashed. If the ice is smashed, the victim takes 3d10 damage and is surprised, granting a free round of attacks. The magic ice cover makes sure encased victims are not helpless. |
| 3 |*Water way* allows you to redirect a flow of water 5ft wide within 300ft. It will even flow through the air for as long as you concentrate. Anybody can swim through the air in the floating water. Even small canoes and the like can travel along these redirected water ways. |
| 4 |*Flash flood* creates a sudden flood from a body of water within 150 ft. Anybody caught by it must save vs. death or be swept away. If wearing metal armor, save vs. death again or drown within a minute or two. |
| 4 |*Part water* allows you to travel through any body of water by parting the water. No matter how deep the ocean, you can travel along the sea floor. The partition will hold for as long as you concentrate. Anybody caught in the water when the partition collapses must save vs. death or die. If they cannot swim or if they are wearing metal armor, they must continue saving every round. |
| 4 |*Frozen sleep* allows you to freeze yourself or any target within 100ft. Inside the ice, your metabolism slows to a crawl, enabling you to survive centuries, if you want -- or imprisoning your foes for centuries, if you want. You have a vague idea of your surroundings while inside the ice and can trigger a thaw when you feel the time is right. When you die, anybody else you are keeping in a frozen sleep will thaw. |

| 5 |*Ice castle* creates an ice  |
