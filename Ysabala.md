This daughter of a devil has built her tower of black obsidian on
*Muspelheim*. She found her way into the realm of fire by learning the
secrets of salamanders she found in a lava cave underneath the Volcano
*Snorrs' Fort* but soon enough she was best friends with some fire
giants, started breeding hell hounds and befriended a fire dragon,
establishing herself as a new power.

Within the tower live twelve [[Hellhound|hellhounds]] and their master, the
[[Ifrit|ifrit]] *Furnace of a Thousand Hell Hounds*, and at the very top
lies the sleeping red [[Dragon|dragon]] *Reykja*. Together, these three
powers just want to be left alone but the scheming Balor demon
*Cutting Flesh for Fun and Profit* has other ideas and keeps them on
their toes.

|= Circle |= Spell |
| 1 |*Ball of fire* creates a big ball of rolling fire in front of you and sends it rolling towards a target within 60ft. Upon impact it explodes and deals 3d6 damage, save vs. spells for half. The ball must travel on solid ground and cannot cross water. |
| 1 |*Flame cloak* surrounds you in fire such that anybody attacking you in melee must take 1d6 damage per round. The spell lasts for 20min or until doused by water. |
| 1 |*Fire resistance* makes one target impervious to one die of fire damage per round. This means flaming oil does not harm you, flaming weapons don't deal an extra 1d6 damage on a hit, you can enter melee against somebody wrapped in a *fire cloak*, and so on. The spell lasts for 1h. |
| 2 |*Firetrap* draws invisible runes of power onto the ground in front of you. If anybody touches it, it all blows up for 4d6 damage, save vs. spells for half. These runes will remain active until triggered, long after your death, if necessary. |
| 2 |*Flaming blade* turns any blade into a flaming blade dealing an extra 1d6 damage. If the blade is not magical, it is considered to be a magic +0 weapon. The spell lasts for 20min. |
| 2 |*Illusion* allows you to create and maintain an illusion as large as a house for as long as you concentrate on it. Anybody touching it may save vs. spells in order to see through the illusion. An illusion attacks like the caster but always has an AC of 9. Illusionary damage will affect you as long as you believe it until you faint. |
| 3 |*Fireball* shoots forth a tiny, flaming missile flies for up to 180ft and explodes upon impact. Anybody within 20ft takes 1d6 damage per caster level (minimum 5d6). Save vs. spells for half. All flammable objects within the blast are set on fire. |
| 3 |*Flame arrows* fills a bucket or any similar container with a magic burning substance that can be used to dip arrows into it. This turns every arrow into a magic flaming arrow which adds an extra 1d6 damage to a hit. Up to 50 arrows can thus be lit. This liquid can also be used like flaming oil, burning for one round for every unlit arrow, dealing 1d8 damage every round until extinguished. |
| 3 |*Feasting* creates food and drink of the finest quality enough for a party of twelve for the entire day. |
| 4 |*Wellness* turns a hall into a lush paradise according to your wishes: palm trees on a sandy beach or high trees around a dark pool of cold water, or hot springs amidst snow: whatever weather, plants and water will allow without actually building anything. This spell must be renewed once a week or this oasis will loose its magic and fall apart within a month. |
| 5 |*Fire proofing* makes a location impervious to fire for a year and a day. This is how you secure buildings in Muspelheim. |
| 4 |*Wall of fire* allows you to create a wall of fire that cannot be crossed by any creature with 4HD or less. When crossed, the wall inflicts 1d6 fire damage. The wall is 10ft high and up to 200ft long. This is enough for a circle with 30ft radius. |
| 4 |*Summoning a lord of fire* summons an [[Ifrit]] from Muspelheim. |
| 5 |*Rain of fire* opens a storm gate to Muspelheim, the realm of eternal fire. For a minute, a great roaring can be heard overhead and soot and ash will fill the air, followed by 10min of liquid fire raining down, dealing 1d8 per round, setting all wooden structures on fire, killing everything that is not protected by a stone roof or impervious to fire. An area as large as a village can thus be levelled. Flying creatures immune to fire can use this gate to cross over into Muspelheim. |
