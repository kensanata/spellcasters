### The Book of Aeromancy


**Air blast** (1) turns the exhalation of the caster into a blast of
air that extinguishes candles and torches up to 30ft away. Flying
creatures such as harpies or giant bees are automatically pushed up to
30ft away. When used on a surprised opponent, they are automatically
*blinded* for a round (-4 to hit).

**Air surf** (1) allows you to glide for up to 300ft through the air
at 60ft/rd. You cannot gain any altitude. As you glide through the
air, you make no sound as you don't need to move.

**Whisper** (1) sends a short message to any creature you have touched
in the last few weeks only for them to hear and transports back their
short reply, only for you to hear, if given within a few seconds. If
they are asleep, the message wakes them up.

**Guided missile** (2) turns a throwing weapon into a terrible
projectile that tears through the air and unerringly strikes anything
you've aimed it at within 120ft, doing triple damage.

**Scream** (2) fills the air with an unbearable screech that causes
the eyes and ears of mammals to bleed, blinding them for two rounds
(-4 to hit) and prevents speaking and spell casting.

**Wind** (2) calls forth a favourable wind. The wind steadily blows up
to 2h in the direction indicated. This is ideal for sailing ships or
land gliders. Anybody blown away by the wind travels as fast as a
pegasus (the fastest creature known).

**Flatten** (3) causes an air blast to flatten anything around you
within 60ft if it isn't rooted in the earth. Creatures smaller than
humans are thrown through the air, taking 1d6/10ft damage when
crashing down. If they attacked you in melee, they take the full 6d6
damage. Human size creatures are blown off their feet and thrown back,
taking 1d6 damage and granting anybody else still standing a +4 to
their attack. Wooden doors, shuttered windows, glass, porcelain, clay
and any other such structures are shattered.
