# Halberds & Helmets Spellcasters

<img class="title" src="Foreword.jpg" />

## Foreword

In [Halberds &
Helmets](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Halberds_and_Helmets), magic
users and elves need to learn new spells from other spellcasters. This
book lists a few of them to act as quest givers and teachers for
player characters.

All the magic users and elves in this booklet are level ten. This
means that the repertoire of these spellcasters is always the same:
two spells of the fifth circle and three spells of every other circle
that.

The magic users have 10d4 hit points and wear no armour (AC 9), elves
have 10d6 hit points and wear fancy elven plate armour and a shield
when outside their homes (AC 2).

As for the spells themselves, it is unavoidable that some classic
spells are repeated. I hope you don't mind. If you have better ideas,
submit them! My email address:

If there are similar spells, then it is up to the players to decide
which variants their characters consider worth learning and which
magic users or elves to befriend.

As for the general classification, this is my rule of thumb:

* if a spell has a quantifiable effect in the 1d6 range, it's a spell
  of the first circle

* many utility spells such as *invisibility* are spells of the second
  circle

* dealing damage in the 1d6 per caster level range is a spell of the
  third circle

* *save or die* effects are spells of the fourth circle

* *shape changing* is also of the fourth circle but if there are
  limits on it (a single shape only, or only flying), then the spell
  is of the third circle
  
* long range transportation like *shadow walking* are spells of the
  fourth circle

* creating pocket dimensions and the like are spells of the fifth
  circle.
