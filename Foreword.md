# Spellcasters

Magic users and elves need to learn new spells from somebody, be it a
monster or another spellcaster, a non-player character with a spell
list. This book lists important spellcasters which can act as quest
givers and teachers for player characters.

Generally speaking they are all level ten. Thus, the spells they have
at their repertoire always consists of two spells of the fifth circle
and three spells of every other circle below that.

They all have 10d4 hit-points, save as a magic-user or elf of the
tenth level, will wear no armor (if a magic-user) or plate armor (if
an elf and out and about), and so on.
