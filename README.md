This repository contains spellcasters and their spellbooks for any old
school role-playing game. Personally, I use them for my
[Halberds & Helmets](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Halberds_and_Helmets)
games.

The generated PDFs are hosted
[on my site](https://alexschroeder.ch/pdfs/spellcasters/).

## Toolchain

If you're interested in the toolchain I'm using: I use Python's
[Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) processor to turn
Markdown into HTML and I turn the HTML into PDF using
[WeasyPrint](https://pypi.org/project/WeasyPrint/).

The font I've used is Accanthis ADF Std No2 from Debian package
`fonts-adf-accanthis`. For more information, see the website of the
[Arkandis Digital Foundry](http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/).
