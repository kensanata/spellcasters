The grand master of the aerial lodge up on /Mount Snoskrida/ is a thin, bald man with a white beard. If you cannot at least /levitate/, you will not gain access to his remote fortress. It is said, that intrepid mountaineers have tried climbing all the way up, but if any ever succeeded, they don't seem to have left any traces. 

They say that he spent twelve years in a [[Jinni|jinn]] palace on /Vanaheim/, learning all their secrets and spells.

== Treasure

The /hawthorn ring/ turns you and everyone you touch into an intertwined group of bushes until dusk or dawn. He likes to use this when he's away from his aerial lodge and needs some quality quiet time.

|= Circle |= Spell |
| 1 |*Eagle Eyes* allows you to see through the eyes of any bird you can see, for 20min. Simply look up at the sky, focus onto a bird and see what it sees. |
| 1 |*Bird Friendship* allows you to talk with all birds for a day. |
| 1 |*Feather Fall* will allow you to fall any distance without taking any falling damage. This spell can be cast at any time, so as long as you are conscious, not gagged, and have at least one free hand available, you can cast it before hitting the ground. |
| 2 |*Invisibility* allows you to turn invisible until you attack a living creature. The spell can be reversed: an /invisibility purge/ dispels all invisibilities within 60ft. Ethereal creatures or people shadow walking are not affected. The purge lingers for 10 minutes. |
| 2 |*Illusion* allows you to create and maintain an illusion as large as a house for as long as you concentrate on it. Anybody touching it may save vs. spells in order to see through the illusion. An illusion attacks like the caster but always has an AC of 9. Illusionary damage will affect you as long as you believe it until you faint. |
| 2 |*Levitation* allows you to defy gravity for 20min. Jump up and keep floating up, climb up vertical cliff faces effortlessly, but beware the end of the spell: you will take the usual 1d6 per 10ft falling damage if you're afloat. |
| 3 |*Lightning Bolt* strikes any visible foe within 200ft and everybody standing between you and them, unless they're very small or lying on the ground. Anything within two feet of the bolt will be affected and take 1d6 damage per caster level (5d6 minimum), save vs. spells for half damage. |
| 3 |*Gaseous form* makes you malleable and gas-like so that you may pass through anything that is not airtight. It also makes you invulnerable to non-magical weapons. |
| 3 |*Flying* allows you to fly at half you movement speed (like a person wearing plate armor) for 2h. When the spell ends and you are still flying, you will fall and take the usual 1d6 per 10ft falling damage |
| 4 |*Like Grass* allows you to ignore all bludgeoning damage and falling damage. If you're hit by clubs, hammers, maces, wrecking balls, rocks, or whatever else, you will simply be flung aside and tumble and roll like a superhero, undamaged. |
| 4 |*Slipstream Travel* turns you and anybody else within 10ft into a magical dust that can follow any living thing as it moves through air or water for as long as you want. Usually, this is used to transport a group of people using birds. |
| 4 |*Whirlwind* transform you into a little whirlwind, destroying wooden structures and dealing 2d6 to anybody in melee with you. Any enemy taking damage must save vs. death or be flung back for a few yards. |
| 5 |*Airstrike* gives you and anybody else within 10ft the ability to run through the air for 20min as if running on an invisible path created just for you. |
| 5 |*Creation* is like making a /wish/: use it to create or destroy inanimate matter as big as a ship. This takes 10min to cast. The creation is powered by elemental air. Using it to generate a ship of gold will work but it will attract other elemental creatures trying to right the imbalance: [[Jinni|Jinn]], [[Ifrit|Afarit]], [[Ghoul|Ghouls]] or [[Marid]], for example.
