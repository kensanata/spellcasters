## Wogan

![Wogan](Wogan.png)
Wogan is a priest of *Freya*, the goddess of autumn harvest and winter
wolves. He oversees a wooden temple on a hill surrounded by a palisade
with three scores of acolytes tending to the sick and the wounded. The
hill is covered in simple huts and long houses dug into the ground so
that all you see are their earthen roofs overgrown with grass.

Wherever Wogan goes he is accompanied by a loyal companion: a white
wolf nearly as big as pony. This is the winter wolf *Frostbite*, HD
5+1 AC 4 bite 1d10 (1–4/6) or breath of ice 2d6 for 5m (5–6/6) F6 MV
15; immune to cold; magical cold only deals half damage; magical fire
deals +1 per damage die; speaks.

### The Book of the Winter Wolf

**Wolf tongue** (1) allows you to talk to all sorts of wolves, dogs
and hyenas for an hour.

**Joyful dog** (1) gives anybody you touch a flash visions of puppies
and happy dogs running around. This vision lifts their spirits and
restores 1d6+1 hit points, up to their maximum.

**Locate creature** (1) gives you a supernatural sense of smell for an
hour. You can tell what kind of creatures walked over the ground or
touched the surface you're sniffing. You can track them. You recognise
anybody you've previously smelled with this supernatural sense. You
can track creatures if you keep your nose to the ground.

**Wolf howl** (2) is a supernatural howl that alerts all the wolves
within a mile or two. These wolves understand the short message you
have sent and act upon it, if they can. In forests, mountains, ruins,
savannas, or swamps 3d6 wolves appear in 10min and stay for up to an
hour, if you want (HD 2+1 AC 7 1d6 F1 MV 18).

**Night vision** (2) grants you and your pack (up to twenty people)
the ability to see 60ft in moonlight or starlight. The only place your
eyes still cannot penetrate is the absolute darkness underground.

**Silent paws** (2) grants you and your pack (up to twenty people) the
ability to run silently for 8h, if and only if you're not wearing
metal armour.

**Ice gate** (3) weakens the veil of the world separating Jötunheim
from your current realm anywhere within 20ft of you. You can fill this
space with a snow avalanche up to 5ft high. Anybody caught in the area
except for you must save vs. paralysis or be buried by the snow. One
buried, victims are immobilised and suffocate in 10min unless dug out
by others. For the next 10min, anybody in the target area can walk
over to Jötunheim, if they want to. Note that when in Jötunheim
without appropriate equipment and clothing, the cold kills you in 2h.
If you cast the spell in Jötunheim, you can cross over to Midgard, the
realm of humans. The gate leads to the patch of snow nearest to your
last location on Midgard. If you have never been to Midgard, it's a
random, snow-covered mountain.

**Werewolf** (3) turns you into a werewolf: immune to normal weapons.
You can fall from incredible heights without taking damage. Fire and
ice won't harm you. Only silver or magic weapons can hurt you – or
spells. Additionally, your natural AC goes down to 5 if it isn't
better, and you can bite for 1d10, if you want.

**Wolf pack** (3) turns you and your pack (up to twenty people) into
ordinary wolves: HD 2+1 AC 7 1d6 F1 MV 18. The wolf's hp may not
exceed the target's current hp. All targets can turn back to their
true form whenever they want, or when they are reduced to 0hp. Any hp
lost as a wolf remain lost when returning to their true form.

**Call of the wolf** (4) summons 2d6 intelligent *shadow wolves* from
the void between the realms. These stay for 10min: HD 2+1 AC 7 1d6 F1
MV 18; surprise foes on 1-5 in 6; only harmed by magic or magic
weapons.

**Dreamtime** (4) gives you and your pack (up to twenty people) access
to the distant past, or maybe a past that never was, a time when
humanity and wolves learned to hunt together, like sisters and
brothers, one pack, one family. A place outside of time. This is where
the big hounds hunt, this is were the immortals tread - the ones that
simply never went back. They decided to remain here, where the
glaciers are thick and strong and the tundra stretches forever. You
can spend as many days and months and years here as you want. By
moving around in the Dreamtime, you also move your point of return.

**To dust** (4) transforms you and all you designate within 10ft into
dust. Unwilling targets must save vs. spells or be turned to dust. If
a wind blows, the dust is picked up and settles in a neighbouring
region. Roll a die to determine the current wind direction when it has
not been established. Use a d10 to determine where you are being
blown: 1 = North, 3 = East, 5 = South, 7 = West, 9 and 10 = nowhere.
Use a d8 when using a hex map. If you are blown out to sea, you are
all going to drown, so don't do that. If there is no wind, you can
call up a gust of wind to blow the dust for 60ft in a particular
direction. There, you can lie in dust form for up to 8h.

**Bone binding** (5) is an ancient ritual by which you can boil away
your flesh, and bind your own bones, turning yourself immortal. The
spell slot for this spell is permanently bound to your bones and no
longer available. You can no longer be healed but if your pieces are
reassembled, you are restored within a week. You can never be killed,
your bones cannot be broken, nor can they be burned, but they can be
ripped apart and buried in far away places to break your power. Your
soul, your senses, your power of speech, and your ability to cast
spells remains bound to your skull for all eternity. And you *know*
where your remaining bones are.

**Imprisonment** (5) allows you to put a dent in reality and seal of a
pocket of time and space, imprisoning a target unless they save
vs. spells. For the imprisoned, time passes by their body requires
neither food nor drink, nor does it age. Thus, they cannot be
resurrected, nor can they be recalled from an afterlife. The prison
weakens within a day unless you spend 10min fortifying it for a year
and a day. If you spend a day fortifying it, the prison lasts for a
thousand years unless the seals are broken. Describe the seals and how
they must be broken for this to occur.
