## Wogan

![Wogan](Wogan.png)
Wogan is a priest of *Freya*, the goddess of autumn harvest and winter wolves. He oversees a wooden temple on a hill surrounded by a palisade with three scores of acolytes tending to the sick and the wounded. The hill is covered in simple huts and long houses dug into the ground so that all you see are their earthen roofs overgrown with grass.

Wherever Wogan goes he is accompanied by a loyal companion: a white wolf nearly as big as pony. This is the winter wolf *Frostbite*, HD 5+1 AC 4 bite 1d10 (1–4/6) or breath of ice 2d6 for 5m (5–6/6) F6 MV 15; immune to cold; magical cold only deals half damage; magical fire deals +1 per damage die; speaks.
