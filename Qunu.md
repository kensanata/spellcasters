## Qunu

![Qunu](Qunu.png)
Qunu is a witch. She's not one of the old and bitter hags cursed by too many deals with the devil, no. She's one of the favorites of [[Hel]], the goddess of magic: charming, powerful, beautiful, intelligent, always a step ahead of the game.

She lives in a beautiful palace built into the *Wall of Aigur*, a sheer wall only reachable by a precarious foot path secured by damp ropes overlooking the Forest of Dreadful Faces. The gate palace itself is guarded by thee three hellhounds *Harm*, *Pain* and *Bones*. On the palace roof there is a viewing platform where the troll *Envy* keeps watch.

The area around her palace is kept safe by the orc tribe *Masks of Fury*. These 50 orcs are sneaky hunters. As far as they are concerned, nobody who needs to walk needs to talk to Qunu. All her friends know how to fly.

**Charm person** (1) affects a single target, save vs. spells to resist. To break free, victims save again every day if their intelligence is 13 or better, every week if their intelligence is average, or every month if their intelligence is 8 or lower. While charmed, victims will treat you as their best friend. Once victims break free, they will remember everything they did and if they did anything they would not have ordinarily have done, they will react with shame and anger. Charms usually cause severe emotional distress!
