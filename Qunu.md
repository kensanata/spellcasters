## Qunu

![Qunu](Qunu.png)
Qunu is a witch. She's not one of the old and bitter hags cursed by
too many deals with the devil, no. She's one of the favorites of Hel,
the goddess of magic: charming, powerful, beautiful, intelligent,
always a step ahead of the game.

She lives in a beautiful palace built into the *Wall of Aigur*, a
sheer wall only reachable by a precarious foot path secured by damp
ropes overlooking the Forest of *Dreadful Faces*. The gate palace
itself is guarded by thee three hellhounds *Harm*, *Pain* and *Bones*.
On the palace roof there is a viewing platform where the troll *Envy*
keeps watch.

The area around her palace is kept safe by the orc tribe *Masks of
Fury*. These 50 orcs are sneaky hunters. As far as they are concerned,
nobody who needs to walk needs to talk to Qunu. All her friends know
how to fly.

### The Book of Witchcraft

**Charm person** (1) affects a single target, save vs. spells to
resist. To break free, victims save again every day if their
intelligence is 13 or better, every week if their intelligence is
average, or every month if their intelligence is 8 or lower. While
charmed, victims treat you as their best friend. Once victims break
free, they remember everything they did and if they did anything they
would not have ordinarily have done, they react with shame and anger.
Charms usually cause severe emotional distress!

**Flying** (3) allows you to fly at half you movement speed (like a
person wearing plate armour) for 2h. When the spell ends and you are
still flying, you fall and take the usual 1d6 per 10ft falling damage

**Puppet Master** (3) allows you to create a puppet of another person,
if and only if you have a bit of their hair. This puppet is linked to
the owner of the hair. Attach some strings to the puppet and you can
control the movements of the other person. You cannot make them drop
something, or pick something up, or say something, or eat or drink
something, but you control their arms and legs. You can make them
jump, dance, fall over, crawl. Anybody who can *see invisible things*
can see and follow the strings that connect the puppet to its master.

**Curse** (4) affects a visible target within hearing distance, unless
they save vs. spells. Curses include *love* (intelligence 3),
*weakness* (strength 3), *trembling* (dexterity 3), *sickness*
(constitution 3), *shape changing* (turn into an animal during either
day or night), *bad luck* (-4 to all saves) and the like. When
pronouncing the curse, you must mention a way for somebody to break
the curse ("until kissed by a prince" or "until invited into a house",
for example). The curse can be broken by a reversal of this spell.

**Doll** (4) allows you to create a doll of another person, if and
only if you have a bit of their hair. This doll is linked to the owner
of the hair. If you lift the doll and hold it close to your face, they
can see your face, hear your voice, smell your breath, feel your
touch. And you can hear them whisper with a very thin voice, too. And
if you stab the doll with hot needles, if you set it on fire, then the
other person suffers the most grievous pain and takes 1d6 damage per
round until their organs rupture, their blood boils and their skin
catches fire. It is a heinous way to go. And while they are dying,
they – and anybody close to them – can see your face, hear your voice.
They know who did it.
