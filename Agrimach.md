## Agrimach

![Agrimach](Agrimach.png)
Agrimach is purported to be the most powerful magic user in the region. He's also an evil necromancer. He built his tower in *Darkwood*.

There is a swamp surrounded by miles of forest, and in this swamp a tribe of small, diminuitive swamp people acts as his eyes and ears. The tower itself is surrounded by water and in this water there lives a seven-headed hydra: HD 7 (56hp) AC 5 7x 1d10 F7 MV 12 ML 9 XP 700); regrowing heads (up to 12); fire breath; poisonous blood.

The lower levels of his tower are full of locked up zombies. In his main hall, twenty zombies watch over Agrimach: HD 2 AC 8 1d8 F1 MV 12 ML 12 XP 200; unaffected by *sleep*,
*charm*, and other such mind affecting spells.

In addition to that, the ghoul *Fiala* serves him as a loyal body guard. They say she serves him because he swore to protect her descendants for as long as she did and that’s what he does.

Sadly, some of Fiala’s descendants learned of this deal and now they’ve turned into bandits, knowing that they’ll be protected by Agrimach when push comes to shove.

### Treasure

The *amulet of treading softly* turns its wearer invisible to the undead as long as they hold their breath. This is how Agrimach sneaks out of his cellar without disturbing the zombies without creating any kind of deactivation mechanism that could be abused. Furthermore, it can be a poisoned gift, as he can show you how it works without revealing that you have to hold your breath, thus ensuring a really mean surprise if you trust it without him.

### The Book of the Dead

**Aura of Fear** (1) affects one victim within 30ft; they must save vs. spells or flee for as many rounds as you have levels.

**Locate Corpse** (1) allows you detect any dead or undead within 120ft. You can try and be more specific, focus on particular attributes of the corpse or even looking for a certain individual if you are in possession of a personal item or a part of their body.

**Read Magic** (1) allows you to read and use scrolls.

**Paralysis** (2) affects one person within 30ft; they must save vs. spells or be unable to move for 1h as they experience death, burial or the pyre, worms gnawing at their bones, flames eating their face and the crushing weight of the earth. Paralyzed victims will drop everything they are holding and collapse.

**Summon Ghoul** (2) summons¹ a diminished lord of the earth, a ghoul; when you cast it for the first time, a special bond is created between you and particular ghoul. Future castings of the spell will keep summoning the same ghoul. There can only ever be one such ghoul.  It will follow your commands but would love nothing more than to eat you alive. Through unspeakable acts anybody it seduces and kills will rise as a free ghoul within 24h. HD 2 AC 6 1d4/1d4/1d4 + *paralysis* F2 MV 9 ML 9; *aura of fear* and *limited shape shift* at will.

**Converse With Corpse** (2) allows you to contact the spirit of the dead and talk to them for half an hour if you are in possession of their skull. The more years have passed since their passing, the harder it will be to understand them.

**Limited Shape Shift** (3) changes you into the animal you feel most connected to (and no other). The effect ends when you will it to end or when you die. Agrimach likes to move around as a wolf.

**Animate Dead** (3) animates the dead and turns them into zombies. You can control up to two times your level in a given round but you are free to animate more. Better keep them in a vault if you do, however. Freed, they'll roam the earth and spread like a plague because anybody slain by a zombie will rise as a zombie within 24h. HD 2 AC 8 1d8 F1 MV 12 ML 12.

**Immunity to Fire** (3) is a magic shield against all fire that lasts 1h. *Fireballs* will explode without harming you. You can walk through the fires of hell without getting hurt. The shield has a diameter of 20ft, and may provide protection for an additional six people, even though you’ll have to move slowly.

**Poison** (4) will instantly kill a victim touched unless it saves vs. poison. This spell can be reverted to *neutralize* a poison, bringing back anybody who died of a poison within the last minute and making them immune to poison for the next hour, allowing them to survive an oncoming *cloudkill*, for example.

**Grafting** (4) enables you to sew together body pieces, such as attaching the leg of corpse to a person that has lost their leg. If you add more limbs than the target had when it was born, you will also have to add extra brains to control the extra limbs. In stressful situations (whenever you need to make a save) there is a chance that the extra brain will act on its own. The chance depends on the number of original limbs and extras: a human with an extra arm has a 1 in 5 chance of the extra arm acting on its own for a round, following a stressful situation.

**Death Ray** (4) is a ray of green energy that will kill its victim instantly unless they save vs. death. Range 120ft.

**Raise Dead** (5) brings a corpse back to life if they have died within the last seven days. It must not suffer from fatal conditions or it will simply die again (decapitated, broken spine, that kind of thing). You need to touch the corpse and it takes about 10min to animate. This usually involves the appearance of an *angel of death* dragging the kicking and screaming soul back into the living world.

**Cloudkill** (5) calls forth a deathly cloud of yellow-green gas that spreads slowly for 1h with 20ft/rd, creeping along the ground, seeping into openings, killing any creature with less than 4 HD; creatures with more HD must make a save vs. poison or die. Even if they make the save, they will take 1 damage/rd. Thus, remaining inside the cloud will kill almost anybody. As it spreads for over a mile in all directions, it creates a true dead zone. Creatures immune to poison are not affected.

¹ **Notes on Summoning**: Creatures summoned are free and independent. They have their own goals. Bargaining may require you to perform a service in return, support them in their bids for power. Invariably, all necromancers get entangled in the machinations of the netherworld. For your own protection, do not summon such creatures outside a circle of protection unless you have a good long term relationship. However, at sunset and at sunrise such a circle will lose its power. You must have reached a settlement by then or dismiss the creature using *dispel magic* or *banishment*. Being charismatic helps: a reaction roll determines the creature's current disposition. Get another +1 bonus if you provide it with corpses or souls, and if you know its true name. You may have found a true name in a book, for example. If you have a free retainer slot available and you have more levels than the summoned creature has hit dice, then the creature *may* enter a long term relationship, taking up a retainer slot.
