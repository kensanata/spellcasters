## Zorkan

![Zorkan](Zorkan.png) On the top of Mount Whiterock there is a palace
of thin towers, elegant arches and long ramps overlooking the mountain
range below, a barren wilderness infested with chimeras, ettins, ogres
and trolls. This is the *Palace of the Mad Emperor*, a structure grown
from the mountain itself by one of the greatest geomancers and his
legacy survived his madness and the folly of his successors. The Earth
Blood leaking into the surface world is the source of both the
powerful magic and the corruption of the land. This is where Zorkan
lives, admired by thirteen students, served by five stone golems (HD 9
AC 1 3d6 MV 12; immune to cold, fire, poison, sleep and charms), and
surrounded by about two thousand clay soldiers. Of these, about fifty
are under the control of the students, constantly building and
rebuilding the palace and its defences (HD 3 AC 6 1d10 MV 12; immune
to cold, fire, poison, sleep and charms).

### The book of Geomancy


**Magic message** (1) enchants a stone such that under the conditions
named it speaks a short message. The conditions named must be such
that the caster knows right then and there whether they are fulfilled
or not. Thus, "when Orland the Wise walks by" is perfectly reasonable
if the caster knows Orland even though the stone has no idea. On the
other hand, "when the assassin of King Gerold the Good walks by" won't
work unless the caster knows who it is.

**Flying stones** (1) causes a rock lying on the ground to levitate.
You can move it around for 10min with the wave of a hand and with an
air punch it flies off up to 120ft and deals 2d6 damage on a target,
save vs. spells for half.

**Stone fist** (1) raises your strength to 18 for 10min: +3 to melee
attacks, 1d6+3 damage, smash doors on a 1–5 in 6.

**Speak with stones** (2) allows you to talk to rocks for 20min.
Sadly, their perspective is limited by their rock nature. They may
report things they heard or saw (if there was light), their memories
go back a long time, but they can't tell individuals apart and their
sense of time is confusing at best.

**Throw a rock** (2) allows you to pick up a large rock and throw it
like giants do: roll to-hit as you would, deal 3d6 on a hit, no save.

**Golem craft** (2) animates clay. This requires a cheap gem set into
the forehead of the little creature. A *clay* golem has HD 3 AC 6 1d10
MV 12. When you reach level 9, you can create a *stone* golem with HD
9 AC 1 3d6 MV 12. Such a creature needs no rest, no food, no water and
no friends. It does not sicken nor will it ever die unless destroyed
by violence. It is not affected by cold, fire, poison, sleep or
charms. Golems do not speak and are a bit dim. They don't use
interesting tactics, they can't cast spells and they don't use ranged
weapons, but they will defend their creator at all costs, taking any
blows aimed at them, if possible. Sadly, while most are loyal servants
they still take a retainer slot. If their creator has more retainers
than allowed by their charisma, the golems may malfunction and gain
independence.

**Raise stone** (2) allows you to slowly raise a boulder as big as a
carriage from the ground. Possible uses include blocking vehicles,
creating a rampart, building a bridge, or rolling downhill. It is
easily avoided by individuals under most circumstances.

**Stone skin** (3) turns your body to some sort of weird stone
material: impervious to cold, fire, poison, and your AC goes down to.
Also, you can no longer swim and you still need to breathe, so good
luck with that.

**Rock throwing** (3) allows you to pick up large rocks and throw them
for 20min like giants do: roll to-hit as you would, deal 3d6 on a hit,
no save.

**Rock swim** (3) allows you to dive into the rock like a fish and
"swim" for 10min and to glide through the earth up to 1000ft. If the
spell ends while you're still gliding through the earth, you suffocate
and remain stuck forever.

**Earth ship** (4) summons forth ship of stone that can glide through
the earth while the sun is up. Only you can make it move. Without you,
or without sunlight, it stops, resulting in a strange stone building.
Similarly, all the trail of destruction it leaves as it plows through
the land are permanent: buildings are destroyed, trees are smashed,
canals are dug.

**Split the ground** (4) allows you to smash your fist into the ground
and split the earth. A fissure opens within seconds, and it keeps
growing longer and wider while you concentrate. If you stand in front
of people and you want the fissure to open underneath their feet, it
will. Anybody within 60ft must save vs. death or fall, taking 8d8
damage. If you have the time, you can turn a peninsula into an island,
or ruin a city, and if you're immortal, you can split a continent.

**Bury the living** (4) allows you to have the ground swallow a living
being standing on it. They must save vs. death or they are buried
alive in a depth unknown. There they remain in a magic stasis until
the end of the world unless they are called forth by a reversal of
this spell. Since they are not really dead, their soul remains
imprisoned in their body and they cannot be raised from the dead
unless they brought back to the surface. It is possible to cast the
reversed spell without a specific target in mind, in which case a
random victim of the past millennias is freed: a powerful and thankful
non-player character of level 6+1d4 with all their equipment on them.

**Earthblood mastery** (5) enables you to find one of those rare spots
where the Veins of the Earth meet and master their energy. From this
spot, you can control the powers of creation. Within 120ft from this
spot, you can create or destroy inanimate matter as you wish. This
takes 10min.

**Stone growth** (5) calls forth the Bones of the Earth and bends them
to your will. Long columns of stone will rise from the ground all
around you and bend and twist as you like. If you use these to fight,
you now have two melee attacks dealing 3d10 each and a reach of 60ft.
After 10min these columns solidify and turn into a fantastic stone
sculptures, towers, dams, or whatever else strikes your fancy. You can
keep growing structures like that and build a mountain, if you have
the time.
