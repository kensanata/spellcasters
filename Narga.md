**Charm person** (1) affects a single target, save vs. spells to
resist. To break free, victims save again every day if their
intelligence is 13 or better, every week if their intelligence is
average, or every month if their intelligence is 8 or lower. While
charmed, victims treat you as their best friend. Once victims break
free, they remember everything they did and if they did anything they
would not have ordinarily have done, they react with shame and anger.
Charms usually cause severe emotional distress!

**...** (1)

**Water walking** (1) enables a target to walk on liquids for 20min.
Usually, this means water, but it might also be lava or quicksand.
This spell does not protect against the heat or noxious fumes.

**Long Dive** (2) allows five people to breathe underwater for 20min.

**Speak with skulls** (2) allows you to reach through time and space
into the afterlife and contact the souls that inhabited the skull you
are holding. The conversation continues for as long as you keep
talking. The soul is not necessarily friendly and cannot be charmed.

**Rock Throw** (3) allows you to open a tiny hole into the *Deep
Earth* and grab a floating rock throbbing with *Earth Blood*. With a
shout, throw, punch or kick the rock and it flies 200ft. through the
air and smashes anything made of wood. Creatures in its path take 1d6
damage per caster level (5d6 minimum), save vs. spells for half
damage.

**Curse of Drowning** (3) allows you to pick a living and breathing
creature and curse them to near drowning for an hour. They lungs fill
with water, they cant speak, they can't cast spells, and they must
save vs. death every time they attempt strenuous activity (such as
attacking). If they fail, all they can do is gag up the water. If they
fail twice in a row (easily avoided by simple not doing anything
everytime you fail), you faint for 1d6 rounds.

**...** (3)

**Like Leaves** (4) allows you to enchant an area of 20ft. diameter
with up to 20 people in it (you included, if you want) in order to
make them as light as dry leaves, and conjure up a strong gust of wind
which will blow all of them to any place you can see within one mile,
allowing them land safely. Anybody trying to resist must save vs.
spells in order to stay. Should they fail, they cannot land safely and
will take at least 1d6 damage if landing on solid ground, plus
1d6/10ft. falling damage for up to 10d6 if applicable (for a total of
11d6 maximum) and half damage when landing in water.
