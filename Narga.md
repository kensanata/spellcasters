## Narga

![Narga](Narga.png) Narga is the Pirate Queen of the South Seas. She's
old now, but her ruthlessness is legendary, and thus the twelve ships
of her fleet are led by loyal captains, each leading about a hundred
men and women. Many a coastal town has been picked clean by them.

Narga was a child of the cruel sea hag Grysella. The hag would lure
ships onto the rocks, slay the crew for unfathomable reasons, but
charm the last surviving man and have his child. These children she
sent away as soon as they had learned her spells. When Narga left her,
she considered the life of a sea hag and decided that she would do
better. When she had lured in her first ship, she simply climbed
aboard and charmed the captain, slowly insinuating herself into the
power structure. And twenty years later, she is the Pirate Queen of
the South Seas.

### Book of the Sea Hag

**Siren song** (1) gives your voice power over people: a single target
must save vs. spells or be charmed when you address them. To break
free, victims save again every day if their intelligence is 13 or
better, every week if their intelligence is average, or every month if
their intelligence is 8 or lower. While charmed, victims treat you as
their best friend. Once victims break free, they remember everything
they did and if they did anything they would not have ordinarily have
done, they react with shame and anger. Charms usually cause severe
emotional distress!

**Needles and puppets** (1) is the art of making and enchanting little
puppets made of straw and twigs and bits of cloth and lock of hair.
Within ten minutes you can enchant the puppet such that it mimics the
actions of the person whose hair you used: when they dance the puppet
dances, when they fight, the puppet fights, and when they talk, the
puppet yaps. Once per day you can stab the puppet with a needle the
owner of the hair takes 1d6 damage. When reduced to zero hit points,
they must save vs. death or die. You can enchant as many puppets as
you have levels. If you enchant more, the older puppets gain
independence and run away, trying to warn the owner of their hair.

**Water walking** (1) enables a target to walk on liquids for 20min.
Usually, this means water, but it might also be lava or quicksand.
This spell does not protect against the heat or noxious fumes.

**Beauty** (2) turns you into a beautiful and alluring young woman for
a day and a night, an eye catcher, one that makes others stumble and
gawk. Your smell is intoxicating, your voice is bliss, your hair so
beautiful people cry tears of joy when they see it. Anybody attracted
to your sex must save vs. spells whenever they want to act against
your wishes. If they make the save, they may move as they wish and say
what they want, for an hour.

**Long kiss** (2) allows you to kiss somebody and create a special
bond between the two of you. Both of you know where the other one is:
you can feel how many days or hours you would have to walk in which
direction in order to meet them. You may cut this bond at any time. If
you don't, it is permanent.

**Speak with skulls** (2) allows you to reach through time and space
into the afterlife and contact the souls that inhabited the skull you
are holding. The conversation continues for as long as you keep
talking. The soul is not necessarily friendly and cannot be charmed.

**Invisible claws** (3) focuses your hate into invisible claws or
blades which whizz through the air, cutting skin and flesh wherever
they can. Roll an attack on anybody within 60ft for every level of
yours and deal 3d6 if you hit. No save.

**Curse of drowning** (3) allows you to pick a living and breathing
creature and curse them to near drowning for an hour. They lungs fill
with water, they cant speak, they can't cast spells, and they must
save vs. death every time they attempt strenuous activity (such as
attacking). If they fail, all they can do is gag up the water. If they
fail twice in a row (easily avoided by simple not doing anything
everytime you fail), you faint for 1d6 rounds.

**Sea of fog** (3) calls forth the fog spirits from a small lake or a
larger body of water. Within an hour, the fog can cover an area so
large it would take somebody half an hour to cross from one end to the
other. This is large enough to fill the streets of a town, conceal a
harbour, hide a reef, or cover a valley. Within the fog, visibility is
limited to a few feet.

**Like leaves** (4) allows you to enchant an area of 20ft diameter
with up to 20 people in it (you included, if you want) in order to
make them as light as dry leaves, and conjure up a strong gust of wind
which will blow all of them to any place you can see within one mile,
allowing them land safely. Anybody trying to resist must save vs.
spells in order to stay. Should they fail, they cannot land safely and
will take at least 1d6 damage if landing on solid ground, plus
1d6/10ft. falling damage for up to 10d6 if applicable (for a total of
11d6 maximum) and half damage when landing in water.

**Summon Kraken** (5) summons a giant kraken from the depth of the
sea. HD 12 AC 4 8×2d6 F6 MV 9 ML 10 XP 1200; anybody hit must save
vs. death or be flung through the air. On land, take an additional 2d6
damage. On sea, fall into the water. When in the water wearing metal
armour, save vs. death every round or drown.
